title: Comfy Zone
description: "*This space is dedicated to my rather exquisite collection of earnestly
  touching quotes. Coming from books, poetry, blog post highlights and everywhere
  else, this is a mosaic of lives' of others and of my own.*    *This is where I come
  seeking peace and hope. This is the place I come to when the world tires me. When
  I am confused and perhaps hopeless, I come here to remind myself what life means
  for me. Decipher the challenges it throws my way. I come here to remind myself why
  there is a sunrise. Every day. Without fail.*"

_It's not for me to conjecture why you are here, but so long as you are, I hope you discover something worth your while. And may you remember and cherish it. Long after you have forgotten this place. That, my friend, shall be my present to you. A gift, only if you choose to accept it._
