The word ‘change’ is hackneyed. Way too much. But still it’s not quite obsolete. It continues to catch our eye. It signifies something unique for each one of us. From political leaders to our morning routines, we all desire a gleam of change. Some perhaps, a revolution; while others, a paced progress.

Coveting change though, particularly in our private lives, does not ensure a friction less transition. Though we know that the said change is very much needed, there is still considerable almost insurmountable resistance to it. 

Partly because change almost never transpires overnight. It is slow and excruciating. Everyday, then, becomes a war of the desire to change against the impulse of resistance. Ergo, winning these quotidian battles are crucial to alter the status quo.

The first step is probably the most easiest. We are already past that. Recognizing the need and making a decision to change.

We all do that. Mostly on new year. 

The second step is a tad bit complex. Analyzing what exactly needs to be changed... what to change/replace it with or for. This requires some introspection. Not easy.

Take the case of that average young girl or guy... who has lived a routinized predictable life. One fine day, they wake up to find themselves face to face with a challenge they hasn't seen before. 

Change. I changed myself. Instead of cursing others or blaming myself, I have forgiven myself. I have **realised** that _being caught up in the past_, wishing you were different or done something contrary to what you did, is not helpful. And while, I have read numerous quotes on this genre and it’s generally so obvious, it is never as _crystal clear_ unless you realise to **apply** it in your life.

Was it overnight? Was it easy? Is it perfect now?

NO

I struggled for months if not years, with this. I felt like I wasn’t making any progress. I still catch myself wishing away the past or regretting how much time I wasted. But I re-focus on the present. I have been doing it for a while now. And I plan on doing it for a while. And eventually, I will bring down my time of reliving the past to near zero.

So this is my story of a beginning of change.

> Whoever you are and whatever you wanna change, this is your takeaway, just take one step at a time, forgive yourself for the slips, be patient but keep exerting. One of these fine days, you’ll get closer there. Promise :)
