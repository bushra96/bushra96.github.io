The word ‘change’ is hackneyed. Way too much. But still it’s not quite obsolete. It continues to catch our eye. It signifies something unique for each one of us. From political leaders to our morning routines, we all desire a gleam of change. Some perhaps, a revolution; while others, a paced progress.

Coveting change though, particularly in our private lives, does not ensure a friction less transition. Though we know that the said change is very much needed, there is still considerable almost insurmountable resistance to it. 

Partly because change almost never transpires overnight. It is slow and excruciating. Everyday, then, becomes a war of the desire to change against the impulse of resistance. Ergo, winning these quotidian battles are crucial to alter the status quo.

The first step is probably the most easiest. We are already past that. Recognizing the need and making a decision to change.

We all do that. Mostly on new year. 

The second step is a tad bit complex. Analyzing what exactly needs to be changed...  the why and the how. That requires some introspection. Not easy. But most do manage to get through.

The third step which is actually the first one really... is the hardest. Because static friction is the greatest of all kinds of friction. Because your mind is hardwired to choose comfort and predictability over growth and possibilities. Because it is truly, physically, mentally difficult to do it the first time on the first day. 

Getting out of bed in cold winters, the beginning of the run, the first pushup, the first word to write, the first page to study... it is so incredibly hard to get started. 

It is arduous just showing up. It is frightening and just so... beyond us.

Well, sure, several things come to aid of those stuck there - motivation, discipline, 5 second rule and so on...

But there is so much against us too. Procrastination, self-sabotage, overthinking, regret to name a few.

These are all related but different issues which we will talk about in detail. For now, you need a simple talisman to work through your days.

While I am not a fan of sweeping generalizations, I do have a general advice.

Most of our 'stuck' problems stem from too much thinking and too little action. For now, take a deep breath and go 5-4-3-2-1 and do one tiny thing that goes in the general direction of wherever that is you wanna go today.

> Whoever you are and whatever you wanna change, this is your takeaway, just take one step at a time, forgive yourself for the slips, be patient but keep exerting. One of these fine days, you’ll get there. Promise :)
