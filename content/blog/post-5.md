The word ‘change’ is hackneyed. Way too much. But still it’s not quite obsolete. It continues to catch our eye. It signifies something unique for each one of us. From political leaders to our morning routines, we all desire a gleam of change. Some perhaps, a revolution; while others, a paced progress.

Coveting change, particularly in our private lives, does not ensure a friction less transition. Though we know that the said change is very much needed, there is still considerable resistance to it. Also, change does not transpire overnight, in most cases. It is slow, excruciating sometimes. Everyday, then, becomes a war of the wish to change against the impulse of resistance. Ergo, winning these quotidian battles are crucial to alter the status quo.
